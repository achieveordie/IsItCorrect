Method to do the labeling: 
User Defined Class as follows-
{correct:Boolean, given_sentence:Str, correct_sentence:Str} 


For Syntax Changing :

For the purpose let's say we have 100 sample sentences in our corpus.
1) 50% Unchanged --- 50 sentences
2) 50% Changed --- 50 sentences

-Method to do this changing:
a) 8% of selected (round down) with Level 4 Intensity --- 4 sentences
b) 9% of selected (round up) with level 3 Intensity --- 5 sentences
c) 18% of selected (round down) with level 2 Intensity --- 9 sentences
d) 28% of selected (round down) with level 1 Intensity --- 14 sentences
e) 37% of selected (round down/remaining) with level 0 Intensity --- 18 sentences

-Intensity Levels:
Level 4: Involves randomly exchanging relative position of 50% of the words in sentences.
Level 3: Involves randomly exchanging relative position of 25% of the words in sentences.
Level 2: Involves randomly exchanging relative position of 10% of words in sentences.
Level 1: Involves randomly exchanging relative position of 3 words in sentences.
    ->If Length of sentence is > 40 words: replace 2*3 words in both [0,length//2] and [length//2, length]
    ->If Length of sentence is 21-40 words: replace 1*3 words in [0, length//3], [length//3, 2*length//3], [2*length//3, length]
    ->If Length of sentence is 10-20 words: replace 1*3 words in both halves
    ->If Length of sentence is <10 words: replace any 3 words
Level 0: Involves randomly exchanging 2 words:
	->50%(round down) of time two adjacent words. --- 9 sentences
	    ->If Length of sentence is > 20 words: misplace 5 words
	    ->If Length of sentence is 10-20 words: misplace 3 words
	    ->If Length of sentence is 5-10 words: misplace 2 words
	    ->If Length of sentence is <5 words: misplace 1 word.
	->50%(remaining) of time one word apart.  --- 9 sentences
	    ->If Length of sentence is >30 words: misplace 3 pairs
	    ->If length of sentence is 15-30 words: misplace 2 pairs
	    ->If length of sentence is <15 words: misplace 1 pair.
	 Misplacing forward and backward takes place with equal probabilities.
