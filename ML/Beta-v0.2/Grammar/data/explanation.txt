Edit(19/12/2020):
->Code to group words with same lemma will be added. This would give more leverage by simply changing
tenses of words by mapping them together via their common lemma.
-> tagged text (`tagged.txt`) contains both tokens and POS, fix bugs.

To facilitate addition of Grammar-based errors into a sentence, I will be using TreeTagger in conjunction with my
existing code. The flow of which will be as follows:

1) Sample_text.txt -> prepare_text.py -> sample_output.txt
2) sample_output.txt -> tagger.py -> sample_tagged.txt
3) sample_tagged.txt -> create_json.py -> sample.json, word.json

Since TreeTagger is available for free use under non-commercial purpose, I have modified it
to suit for our needs which will not be available here. To use original version, visit
