To facilitate addition of Grammar-based errors into a sentence, I will be using TreeTagger in conjunction with my
existing code. The flow of which will be as follows:

1) Sample_text.txt -> prepare_text.py -> sample_output.txt
2) sample_output.txt -> tagger.py -> sample_tagged.txt
3) sample_tagged.txt, sample_output.txt -> create_json.py -> sample.json, word.json

Since TreeTagger is available for free use under non-commercial purpose, I have modified it
to suit for our needs which will not be available here. To use original version, visit
https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/

-> There is no limit to the number of lines that can be tagged in a single file,
the current version of `sample_output.txt` contains 1127 lines, out of which 6 are
newlines and hence the number of lines in `sample_tagged.txt` is 1121.
