To facilitate addition of Grammar-based errors into a sentence, I will be using TreeTagger in conjunction with my
existing code. The flow of which will be as follows:

1) Use `prepare_text.py` to convert `sample_text.txt` into convenient TreeTagger format (sample_prepared.txt).
2) Call TreeTagger with a python wrapper onto sample_prepared.txt to get sample_pos.txt
3) Use that output file to create a json for each type of POS.
4) Use that json file to replace a particular POS with another(incorrect) word.

Since TreeTagger is available for free use under non-commercial purpose, I have modified it
to suit for our needs which will not be available here. To use original version, visit
https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/

-> There is no limit to the number of lines that can be tagged in a single file,
the current version of `sample_output.txt` contains 1127 lines, out of which 6 are
newlines and hence the number of lines in `sample_tagged.txt` is 1121.
